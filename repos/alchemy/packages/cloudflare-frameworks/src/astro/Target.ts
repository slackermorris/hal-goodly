/**
 * The Astro-specific deploy-target contract.
 *
 * framework-core's generic `DeployTarget` covers the platform-neutral seams
 * (`bundle`, `build`, `finish`, `serve`, opaque `config`). Astro needs one
 * framework-specific hook on top: the Astro *integration* (the adapter) that
 * gets pinned into the in-memory `AstroInlineConfig` for both `dev` and
 * `build`. Everything platform-specific — which vite plugins the adapter
 * injects, which server entrypoint it selects, how dev SSR executes — lives
 * inside that integration, so the framework half of this package never has to
 * know the platform.
 *
 * The Cloudflare implementation ships at `@alchemy.run/cloudflare-frameworks/astro/cloudflare`;
 * a future platform (AWS, ...) implements the same interface as a new subpath
 * without any change to the framework module.
