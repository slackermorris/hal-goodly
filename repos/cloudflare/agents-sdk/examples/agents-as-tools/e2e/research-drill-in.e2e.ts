/**
 * Helper-routing tests — drilling in to a helper panel must connect
 * to the helper class that produced it.
 *
 * The 2026-04-28 bug fixed in `e9c0e0ff` (`agent: "Researcher"`
 * hardcoded in `<DrillInPanel>`'s `useAgent({ sub: [...] })`) was
 * a pure browser-side routing bug: drilling in to a Planner panel
 * spawned a fresh empty Researcher facet and the side panel hung
 * on "Connecting to helper…" with no surfaced cause. The server-
 * side test harness couldn't catch it — there are no DO-side
 * frames involved.
 *
 * These tests pin the routing per helper class:
 *
 *   - Researcher: drill-in side panel reports `helperType=Researcher`
 *     and renders messages.
 *   - Planner: same, but the side panel reports `helperType=Planner`.
 *     Without the fix, the panel would render a Researcher header
 *     (or hang silently); with the fix, the side panel's
 *     `data-drill-in-helper-type` resolves to "Planner".
 *
 * Because we use a real LLM, the prompts are deliberately
 * tool-biasing — "Research X" / "Plan how I'd implement Y" — so
 * the model picks `research` / `plan` rather than `compare` or
 * plain chat. If a prompt ever flakes to the wrong tool, the test
 * fails fast on `waitForHelperOfType`'s 60s budget rather than
 * silently producing a misleading pass.
