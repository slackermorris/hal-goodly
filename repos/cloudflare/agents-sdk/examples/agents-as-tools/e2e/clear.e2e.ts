/**
 * Clear button — wipes both the chat history and the helper-runs
 * registry. After clear, the page should look exactly like a fresh
 * load: no messages, no helper panels.
 *
 * The flow we're verifying is the `clear` callback in `App` that
 * calls `agent.call("clearHelperRuns")` BEFORE `clearHistory()`.
 * If the order were reversed (or `clearHelperRuns` were skipped),
 * a refresh after Clear would resurrect helper panels via
 * `Assistant.onConnect`'s replay path. We catch that with a
 * quick reload at the end.
