This is an MCP server for anyone building with Agents SDK. It exposes just 1 tool.

```json
{
  "name": "search-agent-docs",
  "description": "Token efficient search of the Cloudflare Agents SDK documentation",
  "inputSchema": {
    "query": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "query string to search for eg. 'agent hibernate', 'schedule tasks'"
    },
    "k": {
      "type": "number",
      "optional": true,
      "default": 5,
      "description": "number of results to return"
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

Connect to this MCP server to any MCP Client that supports remote MCP servers.

```txt
https://agents.cloudflare.com/mcp
```

## How it works

It pulls the docs from Github, chunks them with a recursive chunker, and indexes them with Orama. The index is cached in KV for 1 day. Search is BM25 with stemming enabled for better results. This allows "hibernation" to match with "hibernate" allowing for more natural language queries.

### Ratelimiting

To avoid ratelimiting by GitHub, you can set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable with `wrangler secret put GITHUB_TOKEN`

## Development

To run this server locally, you can use the following command:

```bash

You can test this server with the MCP Inspector.

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

## Deployment

To deploy this server to Cloudflare Workers, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm run deploy
```
