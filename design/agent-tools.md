# Agent Tools

Agent tools are the orchestration layer that lets a parent agent run a
chat-capable sub-agent as part of a larger operation. The shipped V1 follows
[`rfc-helper-sub-agent-orchestration.md`](./rfc-helper-sub-agent-orchestration.md).

The parent owns a framework table, `cf_agent_tool_runs`, that records each
logical run by `runId`: parent tool call id, child class, safe input preview,
display order, status, summary, and terminal error metadata. The child remains a
normal sub-agent facet and owns the full chat transcript plus resumable stream
chunks. Think children use `cf_agent_tool_child_runs` to map `runId` to the
underlying Think request and stream ids; AIChatAgent children use
`cf_ai_chat_agent_tool_runs` to map `runId` to their `saveMessages()` request.

`runAgentTool(Cls, options)` is the foundational API. It inserts the parent row
before waking the child, starts the child adapter idempotently by `runId`,
forwards child `UIMessageChunk` bodies to parent clients as
`agent-tool-event` frames, records a terminal state, and retains the child facet
for replay and drill-in. `agentTool(Cls, options)` is a small AI SDK tool
factory layered on top for model-selected dispatch.

The React surface is intentionally headless. `applyAgentToolEvent` reconstructs
child `UIMessage.parts` from opaque chunk bodies and groups runs by parent tool
call id; `useAgentToolEvents` subscribes to the existing parent connection and
deduplicates replay/live races. Applications own layout, panels, and drill-in
UI.

V1 supports Think children and AIChatAgent children. Live child chunks cross
Durable Object RPC as byte-encoded newline-delimited records; the parent decodes
them and broadcasts `agent-tool-event` frames. Cancellation is bridged by
parent-side cancellation callbacks rather than serializing `AbortSignal` across
Durable Object RPC. If a parent restarts while a run is non-terminal, V1 replays
stored chunks and marks the parent row `interrupted`; live-tail reattach is
deferred.

Think child completion is not tied to assistant text. Assistant text is only the
default summary source for chat-like helper agents. Workflow-style Think
children can complete without text chunks and can expose durable structured
output through `getAgentToolOutput()` plus an optional `getAgentToolSummary()`
override. This keeps execution, observation, and result synthesis separate:
finishing the turn determines terminal status, child chunks are retained for UI
observation, and output/summary hooks determine what the parent receives. The
output hook is evaluated immediately after the child turn resolves, so workflow
children should commit durable output before the turn finishes and keep summaries
small enough for display.

## Tradeoffs

- Runs and facets are retained by default so refresh, drill-in, and debugging
  work after completion. Applications must call `clearAgentToolRuns()` when
  clearing chat history or enforcing retention.
- The parent registry stores input previews, not raw inputs, to avoid creating a
  second prompt store.
- AIChatAgent agent-tool turns are headless. Server-side tools work normally,
  but browser-provided client tools are not available unless the application
  models the interaction as server-side state or a separate parent-mediated
  workflow.

## History

- [`rfc-helper-sub-agent-orchestration.md`](./rfc-helper-sub-agent-orchestration.md)
  — accepted V1 direction for `runAgentTool`, `agentTool`, event forwarding,
  replay, and cleanup.
