/**
 * Per-file registration state.
 *
 * While a test file's module body is evaluating, `describe`/`test`/hook
 * calls register nodes against that file's collector. The runner imports
 * all test files in PARALLEL; attribution stays correct because the
 * collector is carried by AsyncLocalStorage — the module loader propagates
 * the async context of the `import()` call into the module's top-level
 * evaluation (and into microtasks queued from it), so each file's
 * registrations resolve to its own root no matter how many imports are in
 * flight.
 *
 * The storage lives on `globalThis` so that a duplicated module instance
 * (e.g. two resolutions of the package) still shares one registry.
